dual token model
1 utility token
1 dividend bearing token <-- increases in price the more utility tokens there are, so more solartainers = more profit

//One Solartainer can bring electricity to about 4000 people in one village.
//1 Solartainer = 1 village ={400 households, 40 businesses, 10 communal facilities}
//Our partner has currently an MoU with one African country for bringing the Solartainer to 500 villages.

//1 solartainer = 80MWh p.a.
//1 SolartainerToken = 1/20th of 1kWh

// Structure: Dividend bearing token offered in token sale
// Inherent Value: Dividend sources, business model; consumer token-incentivized customer and operators base
// Supply: per MoU amount of Solartainer to be deployed
// Distribution: Through token sale and on secondary exchanges (“transferable securities”)
//The Hedonic Pricing will support us in modeling the investment token offering
//continuous token model dependent on new solartainers MoUs
//one curved bonding token, price increases with supply because more DBTs = more solartainers = more SolartainerTokens = more dividend potential

//The Network Capital theory is especially helpful in developing an understanding for the supply and exchange models of the community token.
//objective = local currency backed by power generated, redeamable for MWh
//one contract per Solartainer
//supply is function of MWh produced * lifetime of container / x,  where x is tokens per MWh
//all token purchases in all SolartainerTokens pay a div to DivBearToken
